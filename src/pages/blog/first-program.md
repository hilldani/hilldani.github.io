These were the first programs I made. They were made with [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/) when I was in highschool. Surprisingly they are still available for download at https://gamejolt.com/@Platyspy/games

## Blue Side of the Moon
Made for a game jam with my brother.

## Ninja runner
The hardest part of this game is getting past the instruction manual.

## Misairu 3
Misairu means missile in Japanese. There was no misairu 1 or 2.
