I had the pleasure of sitting down with [Arun Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunpgupta/) to talk about PMU's (hardware performance counters/performance monitoring unit). Before m7i, AWS had only exposed PMU's in metal instances and full socket instances. After pushing for several years AWS finally exposed PMU's in all m7i instance types.
